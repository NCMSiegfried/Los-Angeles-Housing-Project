Sited on over 12 private acres, with soaring jetliner & ocean views, experience the serenity of this gated compound with full LA county stamped plans for a 5, 000+ SF residence and guest suite. Developers: Take advantage of the massive upside and build a spec estate on this existing footprint with full LA county approved plans, designed by FAME Architecture & Design. This residence has received approvals for square footage, building volume, and building height from the Los Angeles County Planning Department, exempting it from the restrictions of the Santa Monica Mountains Local Implementation Program, which limits hilltop construction in the area. This presents a rare opportunity to build a home on one of the last remaining developable hilltops in Malibu. The design of the residence fully embraces the dramatic ocean views to the southwest, the vast expanse of skies overhead, and the encircling mountains by thoughtfully dispersing the main house, guest house, garage, and pool across the landscape. These elements are seamlessly linked by walkways that align with the ocean vista, creating a strong connection between the home and its stunning natural surroundings. As you approach the home, a concrete wall floats above the foyer, creating a sense of intrigue by balancing concealment and revelation. Meanwhile, a bronze grid delicately frames the sky above and once inside, leads you to the second-floor primary suite. A covered walkway guides visitors from the guest house to the rear fire pit and deck, offering a moment to appreciate the untamed eastern landscape. Perched dramatically at the cliff's edge, the pool is set apart from the rear deck of the main house, heightening the sense of exclusivity and immersion in the landscape. At the heart of the home, curved glass walls define the living and dining rooms, seamlessly blending indoor and outdoor spaces as they flow into the expansive deck with its panoramic views. Every aspect of the site planning and architecture is orchestrated to elongate movement across the terrain, amplifying the natural beauty of the environment. Simple yet elegant geometries overlap and intersect, creating a structure that feels both sculptural and monumental, yet remains humbly subservient to the natural landscape. Working septic is in place alongside a well, water and utility hookups. Final approval of a Woosley Fire Exemption and permit has been granted, expediting the path to build and saving years of time. Majestic scenery abounds including 360 degree canyon and mountain views with some of the most breathtaking ocean vistas in all of Malibu; quite possibly the most peaceful retreat available today in Western Malibu. This Woolsey fire rebuild project offers the opportunity to build more than 5, 000 interior SF across two different structures. Additionally, a flat concrete pad perfect for creating a Pickleball, basketball or tennis court, sits farther down on the property. This estate is an ideal choice for entertaining.

So how about this one...You wake up early at Longview to an unobstructed view of the Pacific. While lingering in bed to enjoy your coffee and email, you check out the waves at Surfrider, then grab your board for some world class shredding. Or maybe you'd prefer to head across the street for an ocean-view hike or jump on your bike to play tennis at The Racquet Club or swim laps at The Pepperdine Crest Club. When you're maxed out on endorphins, you slip into your private spa and watch the red-tailed hawks circle above, take a little nap, swinging in your outdoor hanging bed, do some work in your private hillside office or make a quick run to the farmers' market for locally grown produce and honey. Before you know, it's time for dinner at Nobu or Lucky's or dancing the night away at Soho House. At the end of the night, you fall asleep to the music of the waves as you try to figure out the difference between your real life and dreams.

Generous amenities, such as a guest house, gorgeous infinity pool, and a lawn large enough to accommodate hundreds of party guests, are complemented by exquisitely crafted details: exposed beams, traditional decorative tilework, and floors of Saltillo tiles and hardwood. The living room is palatial, with its soaring ceiling, clerestory lights, large fireplace, arched doorways, and enormous arched window facing the sea. The chandelier dining room, also with a fireplace, overlooks the pool and ocean views. The chef's kitchen, with skylight, ocean view, and superb tilework, has a large island, granite countertops, wine storage, a walk-in pantry, and a lovely breakfast area. The home's bedrooms are arranged in two separate wings for maximum privacy, space, and views. One wing has two bedrooms on the main level that open onto a private patio and palapa, plus a staff/guest suite on the lower level, complete with two bedrooms, office, and living room/kitchenette. The owner's wing is a stunning ocean-view retreat with a fireplace, clerestory accent windows, arched doorways, a large cedar-lined walk-in closet, and glass doors that open onto an open-air patio refuge. A gorgeous bath with sparkling emerald tilework opens to a large lounging terrace where a portico shades an ocean-view spa. This majestic suite also features a private sitting room with a fireplace and quiet loft space that could be an office, yoga room, library, or art studio. The enormous backyard, which commands spectacular ocean, island, and Queen's Necklace views, features a sublime infinity pool, Jacuzzi, full outdoor kitchen, bar seating, and numerous patio areas for day and evening entertaining. The guest house, scenically sited on a lower part of the estate, is entirely separate from the main residence. Adjacent to the expansive lawn, it has a wraparound porch and patio with an outdoor kitchen and a pergola for al fresco dining. Created with the same exacting attention to detail as the main house, the guest accommodations include a double-height living room and full kitchen, fireplace, dining and lounging gallery, bedroom, bathroom, powder room, and additional loft bedroom. There is also a laundry room plus a lovely pergola-shaded patio with a hot tub. Among the property's many additional features are a separate gated service entrance with a large motor court and event-staging area, a large solar array, and a three-car garage plus ample parking for 20 or more vehicles. One of the adjoining parcels features an approximately 800 square foot cinderblock structure, fully permitted by Charter Communications and complete with generator and air conditioning. Sublimely private and yet located just minutes from trails, beaches, and all the amenities of Malibu, this is a legacy property designed for a lifestyle of luxury and comfort.

The zoning is R-C-20 or Rural Costal with a 20-acre minimum. This allows a main home, a second home, and a guest home for a total of 3 units. The electricity line is in approximately 210 feet in front of the property. Water is by water well. This 20 acre property may or may not be in the costal commissions jurisdiction and the property has the same building rights/restrictions as any other Malibu property. There are no deed restrictions. It appears there are several building pads. The property is not a flat 20-acre property but is hilly with panoramic ocean views, views of Catalina Island, as well as other beautiful views of the Santa Monica Mountains. This property starts at the end of Clausen Road. Clausen Road is shown on the parcel maps and there is an entrance just a few feet north of the 20 MPH sign. This is a few feet north of 2559 Latigo Canyon Rd, Malibu, CA 90265. There has been no maintenance of this dirt road as the only property it ends up at is this 20-acre parcel. The property starts downhill and then goes uphill, thus the home should be built on stilts starting at the end of Clausen Road or a bridge can be built to one of the hilltops. Please check with the County of Los Angeles building department. It may not be economically feasible to build as I was told that the road to the property needs to be able for the fire trucks to enter and then turn around to exit. Thus this may be only good for transfer development credits.

https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/1634003682,WECA,23-271072,SOLD,"An architectural treasure and an icon of Malibu design with 122 feet of beachfront, Sandcastle was the hand-built home of visionary architect (and surfer) Harry Gesner. Offered for sale for the first time, this tranquil Western Malibu oceanfront property is, according to Gesner, a dream place, built with love. When the young architect set out to build his family home, he had big ideas, little money, and an abiding passion for the natural beauty of the secluded cove with a nearby surf break and an empty plot right next door to his most famous building, Wave House. With a roofline inspired by a sandcastle, Gesner was determined to build a home that would fulfill what turned out to be a lifelong philosophy: You have to have a view. You want perspective to your life. The home's texture was determined in part by the materials he salvaged as an early evangelist of sustainable construction: telephone poles, reclaimed bricks, wall panels made from aqueduct pipes, birdseye maple from a high school gym, old-growth redwood harvested in the 1800s, and windows and doors saved from one of Hollywood's silent film theaters. As Gesner said about Sandcastle in Houses of the Sundown Sea: The Architectural Vision of Harry Gesner, the book about his life and work, The spirit in the design and materials are what you immediately feel in this house. All people who enter and spend a brief period or long time here immediately feel at home and relaxed. The experience never becomes commonplace or boring because over everything is the sound and rhythm of the waves breaking on the shore in front of the house. At the home's entry is a lovely library/sitting area with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and ocean views. With massive spoke-like beams and a wood-plank ceiling, the heart of the main house is a window-wrapped space that comprises generously scaled living and dining areas with an enormous brick fireplace at its hub. Inspired by the Hollywood Bowl, Gesner built the fireplace as a stage for his wife, actress Nan Martin, with a huge polished concrete hearth. A lovely solarium with stained glass panels flanks the dining area, and the ocean views enjoyed from the interior areas extend to the wraparound deck just outside.Echoing the cylindrical shape of the house itself, the kitchen wraps around a circular island and has tile countertops, stained glass lunettes fitted into the beams overhead, a fireplace, updated appliances, a breakfast bar, and a walk-in pantry. On the home's main level are two en-suite bedrooms, one with built-ins suitable for an office.Upstairs is the primary suite tower, with high ceilings, huge beams, charming eyebrow windows, a brick fireplace, an ocean-view sitting area, and a spiral staircase with handmade driftwood treads leading up to a studio/loft/meditation space.The property's additional structures include an ocean-view tree house apartment with a kitchenette, living room/dining area, bedroom, bath, and wraparound deck; a boat house with a full kitchen, ocean-view living/dining room with a built-in table and porthole windows, a full bath, and a bedroom; and another one-bedroom apartment nest with ocean view and stained glass above an indoor/outdoor cabana. There is also an open-air living area, deck, and teepee-covered daybed.The approximately 0.73-acre property has a three-car garage and additional parking platform, a covered deck, a brick patio, lawn, an outdoor shower, surfboard and other storage areas, steps to the beach, and multiple vantage points for breathtaking sunset views.

Amazing ocean and mountain views in Malibu from this authentic and beautiful Mediterranean Malibu estate that would be at home in France, Italy, or Spain, is beautifully proportioned with spectacular mountain and ocean views of Surfrider Beach, Point Dume, and Santa Monica Bay, and is perfectly situated to enjoy both the sunrise and sunset. The enchantment of the home and mature landscaping surrounding the property beckon from a European holiday, yet it's an easy commute to Santa Monica or LA, being located in Eastern Malibu, close to Soho House, Nobu, beaches, schools, and shops. The house comes with access membership to La Costa Beach Club and tennis courts. An enchanting open floorplan boasts five bedrooms, many of which lead to the adjacent, tree-lined courtyards through tall French doors, plus two attached guest offices or bedroom suites. Romantic finishes and tall ceilings throughout, tall windows of sun-filled glass from the living and dining rooms feature the vast ocean views over Carbon Beach and the custom solid wood cabinetry in the kitchen and bathrooms offer warmth and charm and well-placed utility for an indoor/outdoor flow. Wolf stove, Sub-Zero refrigerator, and double copper sinks in the kitchen overlooking the pool and courtyard. The beautiful wall sconces offer a subtle and calming evening light that leads to the upstairs, primary bedroom suite that has endless ocean views of Point Dume and Catalina, plus a private, attached office or sitting area facing the ocean and roof-top deck area. You can live off the land here with avocados, bananas, oranges, and other fruit trees, plus a vegetable garden. There are wonderful decks on each level of the home and multiple places to sit for reflection and contemplation while viewing the mountains and the sea. The ocean-view backyard area has a large sun-drenched lawn and a beautiful pool, entertainment deck areas, and an outdoor kitchen, plus a special, very private area overlooking both the ocean and the Santa Monica mountains. The home is fully fenced and gated and has an upper and a lower driveway, there is parking for at least 10 cars, and as you enter the double gates from the upper entrance, you are greeted by an authentic meditation labyrinth to remind you that home is where the heart is. There is an entire home and landscape fire deterrent system and a backup gas-powered generator. Currently owned by film producers, the house was featured in a cover story in PEOPLE MAGAZINE when it was previously owned by country music star, Kenny Chesney, (It's also sometimes referred to as the GET SHORTY house since scenes from the Gene Hackman/John Travolta/Danny DeVito movie were shot here.) Quote from the owners: A classical Mediterranean house that you might expect to find in Mallorca or the Italian Riviera but we found right here in Malibu, where you can view the sunrises and sunsets and the mountains and the sea and the magical play of light between them. We toured 70 houses in Malibu over a year and a half before we found the one we loved. When I heard the sound of the antique fountain in the Spanish courtyard, I was transported to Spain.

Space: A romantic, 6, 600+ SF Mediterranean estate perched on 4.3 acres of rolling Malibu hillside means room for everything and everyone - inside and out. And your very own mature, producing vineyard means the space that gives you room to breathe also gives you wine to savor. Privacy: Your tranquility is ensured by a gated entrance and a dramatic driveway that lazily winds through your vineyard... the real world couldn't be further from your mind. Inside, five generous ensuite bedrooms with direct access to multiple outdoor living spaces means that each guest has their own private enclave... without leaving the home. Views: The estate's beauty extends beyond its boundaries. Your views - framed by your vineyard in the foreground - include the legendary Malibu hills, the intoxicating Pacific Ocean and a nightly light show in the sky that stuns every single time. Luxury: It's rare to find a home that lacks nothing. But with a resort-like pool & spa, two levels of outdoor living, a private tasting room, a climate-controlled wine cellar, an in-home movie theater, a zen atrium and a convenient elevator, only one thing is missing from 5941 Kanan Dume Road: someone to enjoy it.
