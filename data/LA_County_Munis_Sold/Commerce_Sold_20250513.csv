It is located close to shopping, schools and transportation, within a short drive to The Citadel outlets as well as all the shopping on Whittier Blvd. Centrally located and accessible to several freeways it is just just a short commute to Downtown LA, the San Gabriel Valley and the East side cities. It has had some upgrades recently but it is a good canvass for you to come and modify to you and your family's liking, it's a must see if you want a place to call home and not have to deal with long drives to get to work while enjoying not being in the middle of the city.
