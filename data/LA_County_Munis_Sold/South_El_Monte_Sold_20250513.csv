The lot is impressive and has tons of potential to add sf, build a guest house, or even look into the new legislations: SB 8, 9 and 10 for redevelopment opportunities! The main house is 2 bedrooms, 1 bath and nicely maintained. There's currently a detached storage building in the back that is a great workshop / home office / storage room. This detached storage building has two separate entry doors each leading to two separate areas divided by a wall. There are also two detached sheds in the backyard. Attached to the house is a single car garage. Lot has a long pavered drive way with double door gated entry to the backyard so you can pull additional cars or even boat around to the backyard too. Beautifully maintained lawn and plants both front yard and back - even a healthy avocado tree! Location is excellent within a nice quiet neighborhood and nearby the schools, shopping, Starbucks, and FWY access. Note: The 2nd bedroom currently opens up to the 1st bedroom making one open big bedroom instead of two small bedrooms but new buyer can easily have the door back facing the hallway instead of the bedroom if a true 2nd bedroom is desired.",SINGLE_FAMILY,1317 Strozier Ave,1317 Strozier Ave,,South El Monte,CA,91733,2,1,,768,1950,,595000,2023-03-03,675000,2021-11-18,702270,805817,11191,879,34.043942,-118.050471,,Los Angeles,06037,1,0,1,Danae Aballi,danae@danaeaballi.com,"[{'number': '7147096558', 'type': 'Mobile', 'ext': '', 'primary': True}, {'number': '9492168565', 'type': 'Home Office', 'ext': '', 'primary': True}]",,,,"Valle Lindo Elementary School District, El Monte Union High School District",http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m2854087212od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75,"http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m2854087212od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m3779660188od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m4024129060od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m2163924315od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m448838474od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m263713823od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m2905743776od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m1865690807od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m3123816027od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m3508285537od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m3199141020od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m506688205od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m1194820660od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m3374488602od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m1855747141od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m768972554od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m1042886213od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m1619424868od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m2012751283od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m1712443507od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m2517247566od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m1360560934od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m1956816233od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m3246761499od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m2210217282od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m2207099083od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m2039050816od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m821713969od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m4073928782od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/da7015f6c5ad310ac020c2bf15c8f447l-m1230400637od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75"
