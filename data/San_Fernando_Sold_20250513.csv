Welcome to this quaint cul-de-sac home with endless possibilities and a price you CAN'T refuse. All types of families, lifestyles, and well... life JUST happening makes this purchase better than any other one.On the side is a long RV-size driveway that leads ALL the way to the back of the house. You can park at lest 5 cars just in this driveway, or leave your RV there. There is an oversized detached garage in the back, with plenty of space for a workshop or of course, a guesthouse/ADU. It's even easier to make Accessory Dwelling Units in the city of San Fernando because it's a separate city with less bureaucracy. Trust me, I just made one myself!The house is all permitted with the addition that has made it a 3-bedroom house. The rooms are spacious and in good condition. The kitchen flows throughout the house. It's close to shopping, schools, and the freeways. Maclay street is developing fast, so time to lock it in before it becomes TOO desirable. Fantastic rental property due to the higher rent it commands from having 3 bedrooms. Will appreciate in value due to location. On a cul-de-sac, so tenants will feel safer.SUMMARY: lowest-price 3 b",SINGLE_FAMILY,906 DE Foe St,906 DE Foe St,,San Fernando,CA,91340,3,1,,1128,1924,38,429900,2019-01-04,440000,2019-02-11,481199,728800,5680,390,34.288134,-118.431861,North Valley,Los Angeles,06037,1,0,2,,,,,,,Los Angeles Unified School District,http://ap.rdcpix.com/1389668723/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m0od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75,"http://ap.rdcpix.com/1389668723/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m0od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/180724099/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m1od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/1433171939/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m2od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/1323181268/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m3od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/125818292/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m4od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2115745140/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m5od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/1151962188/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m6od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/1933120577/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m7od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/374747358/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m8od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/1230599628/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m9od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2008848605/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m10od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/210432460/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m11od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/1529092082/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m12od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2022924278/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m13od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/1481752130/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m14od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/1541036677/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m15od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/334622107/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m16od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/30741391/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m17od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/1295612246/1935dfc5ad5177c2b893eedc6d5a8acal-m18od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75"

The property consists of a ground floor serving commercial space ideal for a wide range of retailers or office uses. The commercial space offers new flooring, central A/C, and a private restroom. The current lessee is on a month-to-month lease creating an optimal scenario for an investor looking to occupy and operate their business while receiving income from the upstairs tenants or an investor seeking long term cash flow. The second floor of the property contains five studio apartment units which have proven to be one of the most consistently in demand layouts for renters in the San Fernando Valley.

This 1950's two-bedroom cottage rests on one of the best streets in San Fernando. The original lath & plaster and classic interior wood doors give this home a vintage and artistic feel. There's original oak wood flooring under the carpet for that instantaneous transformation and just a bit more sweat equity to really make this home your own.

The cute little entrance porch welcomes you before entering the living room that flows into a separate dining room adjacent the open kitchen leading outside through the laundry service porch. The bedrooms are both good sized and each have two windows offering a ton of light. There is an exceptional & surprisingly good amount of linen and closet space as well. Some other upgrades to note are: dual pane windows, copper plumbing, roof, central HVAC, and lateral waste line with cleanout.

Crown moldings, recessed lighting, and FULLY UPGRADED BATHROOMS define the truly turn-key ready home. The spacious bedrooms fit any size family. Modern dual-pane vinyl windows will preserve energy in the summers. Recently upgraded ROOF, PLUMBING, ELECTRICAL, A/C, AND TANKLESS WATER HEATER. Stop looking at beat-up homes - this is truly what you deserve.A spacious backyard and OVERSIZED RV access lead to a new ADU. It has 1 bedroom - not a studio like many other ADU's. It will command higher rent and better tenants. Next to major freeways, in a quaint, safe part of San Fernando - there will not be an opportunity like this for the rest of the year.",MULTI_FAMILY,1909 7th St,1909 7th St,,San Fernando,CA,91340,,,,1140,1951,25,619900,2019-10-03,630000,2019-10-28,675484,855000,5706,553,34.299527,-118.432939,North Valley,Los Angeles,06037,1,0,,,,,,,,Los Angeles Unified School District,http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m3970396486od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75,"http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m3970396486od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m3404033637od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m2163396219od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m452333239od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m708285962od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m2021202254od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m3351896708od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m3249938326od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m3834415597od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m1796167547od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m62877626od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m250151548od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m3510309014od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m2965571616od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m719397861od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m1791870798od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m3123111316od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m3251980619od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m1026956241od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m2031515847od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m830984345od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/311558b7131930266d7dc96289602d05l-m4015850545od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75"

https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/1880293073,MRCA,SB21247167,SOLD,"Excellent opportunity for a buyer to get into a starter home, with lots of potential. This property is larger than most 2 bedroom homes that have sold in the area. The lot is also huge with almost 7, 300 SF that offers plenty of room to build an addition and an ADU or a pool if you want. The home needs a little TLC. However, there is a nice brick fireplace in the living room and the original hardwood floors throughout the entire home were previously refinished. There are upgraded vinyl windows. There is lots of closet space and storage, newer kitchen cabinets and a large laundry room by the back door. As you enter the backyard, you will see the large yard with a couple of shade trees, a good sized patio for entertaining with a brick outdoor grill. You will love all the parking that is available on the driveway, even for an RV. There is a one car garage plus an office/bonus room.
