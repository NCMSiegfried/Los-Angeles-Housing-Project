https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/2244327619,MRCA,SB24109741,SOLD,"Welcome to 913 McCarthy Ct. This beautiful home, fully rebuilt from the ground up in 2019, stands at 2, 151 square feet and consists of 4 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, a huge custom kitchen, and an open floor plan. The property will blow you away with its 10, 089 square foot lot that widens at the rear, creating a truly spectacular backyard. Attention to detail is evident throughout the home. As you enter, you are greeted by a printed tile floor entry, transitioning to engineered hardwood floors that run through the kitchen, den, and common areas. The kitchen features stacked double ovens, an 8-burner 48 cooktop, a coffee bar with a designated sink, a custom-built center island table over 11 feet long, a walk-in pantry, a built-in home office/workstation, and more cabinet storage than you can imagine. The living room, adjacent to the kitchen, boasts a beautiful 6-foot-long fireplace, floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the backyard, and large French doors leading to the covered and heated rear patio. The bathrooms are equally impressive, each featuring unique custom elements such as porcelain tile floors, Venetian plaster walls, custom vanities, and heated floors.

The spacious living room is warm and inviting for friends and family to gather around its wood-burning fireplace. The living room is open to a sunny dining space with direct access to the backyard. The separate kitchen offers washer/dryer hook-ups, a refrigerator, and an entrance off the driveway, easing the chore of unloading groceries. Wood cabinetry with glass front uppers and a corner sink overlooking the south-facing backyard finish the space. On the west side of the home, the two nicely sized bedrooms are separated by a full bathroom and hallway closets for extra storage. Stepping outside in the backyard, a group of tall palm trees lead the way to the two-bedroom, one-bath ADU. Originally a garage, the converted space offers a sunny living area, eat-in kitchen, and generous backyard. The ADU was leased for $3000/month in its current condition from dates 11/22-1/24. Greater income may be possible with a few upgrades. El Segundo offers highly rated schools, a charming downtown, and proximity to freeways, LAX airport, and the beach.

The unit has two assigned side-by-side parking spaces and storage lockers in the subterranean gated parking lot, and the pool area has been undergoing a facelift with new decking, pool and spa refinishing, and new landscaping just in time for your summer enjoyment!",CONDOS,815 Main St Apt 206,815 Main St,Apt 206,El Segundo,CA,90245,2,2,,1145,1983,40,735000,2024-05-17,740000,2024-06-26,494820,750600,24041,646,33.927577,-118.416537,Silicon Beach,Los Angeles,06037,1,450,2,Wendy Mason,wendymasonscv@sbcglobal.net,"[{'number': '6613133032', 'type': 'Mobile', 'ext': '', 'primary': True}]",,,,"ICEF Inglewood Middle Charter Academy District, Da Vinci Communications High District, Da Vinci Connect District, El Segundo Unified School District, Da Vinci Design District, Da Vinci Science District",http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m2797220206od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75,"http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m2797220206od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m208680672od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m2691044878od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m3467100869od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m1921740707od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m1260126645od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m3811383518od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m2738997643od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m3251846246od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m2544056334od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m1707176286od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m316241104od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m4033976917od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m2221088382od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m3158335845od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m3454361058od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m401906460od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m994531614od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m2877495001od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m534471119od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m3136155008od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m1088215007od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m556240461od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m232898323od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m854277373od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m856476901od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m3989880216od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/2cc01a0362ef9051acefda58f8349872l-m2488112034od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75"

https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/2127461623,MRCA,SB20219839,SOLD,"Perhaps once in a generation, a legacy estate becomes available in El Segundo. The property at 709 W. Pine Avenue sits on an oversized lot which is a shade over a quarter of an acre - the facade is a period correct replica of an 1825 Georgian home. Meticulously crafted by the owners, the details are unlike anything you are likely to find in modern day construction. The home features five bedrooms and four bathrooms in 4760sf (btv) - with a large family in mind, all the bedrooms are located on the second level - in addition there is an approximately 1200sf bonus/playroom on the third level where there is also a sauna and numerous storage spaces. On the lower level there is a dedicated office/library - a magnificent fireplace takes pride of place in the Living Room - a large dining room and a huge Family Room, also with a fireplace, with French doors that open to the yard - a magnificent chef's Kitchen completes the house. There are two staircases for ease of access to the upper floors - hand laid flooring throughout using various woods and detailed inlays. A driveway on the east side of the property leads past mature fruit trees to the two car garage at the rear of the property - above the garage is an artist's studio. The back patio overlooks a rose garden, however there is enough room should a future owner wish to include a swimming pool. The beach is less than a mile away. This is truly a one of a kind property and must be seen to be appreciated.",SINGLE_FAMILY,709 W Pine Ave,709 W Pine Ave,,El

https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/2427415193,MRCA,SB21117177,SOLD,"With summer finally here this is the perfect home to welcome the season! Incredible location just steps from Rec Park. Right in the heart of El Segundo. Steps from charming Main Street where you can stroll to grab coffee from The Blue Butterfly or quick bike ride to the beach. Walk up thru the ample front yard to freshly painted exterior of this wonderful house. As you enter the doors the 1st bedroom/office is to your left. Walk farther into the home and the kitchen is situated to your left and is bright and clean. The open floor plan with dining area and family room is large with updated flooring and beautiful decorative fireplace for those chilly coastal nights to stay in. Walk farther to the back of the house and there is a direct entrance to the large attached 2-car garage. And a wonderful very private intimate back patio right off of the back hall. Ideal for a BBQ or to lounge with a good book. Let's make our way up the stairs where the master suite is located. Dazzling sunlight fills this wonderful oasis. With vaulted ceiling and exposed beams that is grand and dramatic. While the large deck that overlooks the neighborhood and the park lets in the gentle ocean breeze. Located up stairs are the other 2 bedrooms which are large, bright and beautiful. Also, upstairs is a quaint reading/sunroom that overlooks the neighborhood and lets in beautiful sunlight. This wonderful home will not last long and has everything to offer for the South Bay lifestyle. All of this just steps from shop, restaurants, award winning schools, and our local beaches.",SINGLE_FAMILY,443 Eucalyptus Dr,443 Eucalyptus Dr,,El Segundo,CA,90245,4,3,,2594,1991,,1725000,2023-03-03,1862000,2021-07-27,1937223,2076500,3500,718,33.92206,-118.413874,Silicon Beach,Los Angeles,06037,2,0,2,Alejandro Abad,alexabad@alexabadrealestate.com,"[{'number': '3108776488', 'type': 'BUSINESS_MOBILE', 'ext': '', 'primary': True}]",,,,"ICEF Inglewood Middle Charter Academy District, Da Vinci Communications High District, Da Vinci Connect District, El Segundo Unified School District, Da Vinci Design District, Da Vinci Science District",http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m2008959862od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75,"http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m2008959862od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m3544816383od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m2548851073od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m3001447530od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m1190119622od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m779081478od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m763883298od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m4188186368od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m2426588266od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m4083774341od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m4075596074od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m1107107240od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m891965091od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m1237139700od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m4098056084od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m467911899od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m4075197434od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m1679251643od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m2302612238od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m943226051od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m3967927059od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m3739423314od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m607609409od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m4120339209od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m1686289253od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m506386777od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/fbbed552b54e8f9dc8e71fd3f5af3e9cl-m466922150od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75"

This location is to-die-for with convenient freeway access and close proximity to Grand Avenue--yet it offers a small-town, quiet feel with walk streets and award-winning schools. The complex includes aots of guest parking, a playground, pool and BBQ area. This is truly a rare gem in an exceptional place!",TOWNHOMES,1329 E Grand Ave Unit D,1329 E Grand Ave,Unit D,El Segundo,CA,90245,3,2,1,1480,1989,,939000,2023-03-03,980000,2021-05-17,1039982,1118700,170228,662,33.920189,-118.40203,Silicon Beach,Los Angeles,06037,3,558,2,Maggie Ding,maggie@maggieding.com,"[{'number': '3103450075', 'type': 'Mobile', 'ext': '', 'primary': True}, {'number': '3109372027', 'type': 'Office', 'ext': '', 'primary': True}]",,,,"Da Vinci Communications High District, Da Vinci Connect District, El Segundo Unified School District, Da Vinci Design District, Los Angeles County Office Of Education School District, Da Vinci Science District",http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m2368487879od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75,"http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m2368487879od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m3909523127od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m581954119od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m1831862552od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m2517295711od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m3020987126od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m3277198882od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m2862791856od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m998310812od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m1068689691od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m747869107od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m1123624894od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m2552267944od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m213783834od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m2989400938od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m1396031836od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m1677219998od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m701578404od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m2700346258od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m3639073135od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m3121038643od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m4209457724od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m147942211od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m4195299536od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m3492624671od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m3094276343od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m4027642766od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m3538984078od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/657d03ac26bf2b773ff5dd3f995d1a9fl-m566269983od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75"

https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/2598354072,MRCA,SB22238504,SOLD,"Perched on a generous corner lot with an expansive, fenced front yard and calming water feature, 736 Center Street's idyllic curb appeal impresses before even stepping inside. But once you do, you're greeted by a spacious, light-filled living room with cozy fireplace and engineered hardwood floors. The adjacent open dining room flows beautifully into the freshly-updated kitchen: the home's heart. Centered around a showcase ILVE double-oven range with 6 burners, this space is more than equipped to handle your most daring culinary adventures. The home's three bedrooms are quietly tucked away at the rear of the home, two of which include direct access to the rear yard (more on this later). A luxurious, vaulted bathroom with walk-in shower and jetted tub is conveniently located right outside the owner's bedroom. 736 Center Street's outdoor space is a true show stopper. Thoughtfully designed, lovingly landscaped and built for large-scale entertaining, this resort-like area includes a sparkling pool, multiple lounging areas and a trellis-topped outdoor kitchen with plenty of bar seating. It's a built-in vacation that's always waiting right outside. Multiple recent updates (including a new HVAC system) and a 2-car garage make this home undeniably convenient... but its location is the real star. With elementary, middle and high schools within walking distance, Downtown El Segundo less than a mile away, quick access to the 105 & 405 freeways and the beach, LAX, Manhattan Village and The Point all less than 6 minutes away, there's a reason why it's called Center Street.
