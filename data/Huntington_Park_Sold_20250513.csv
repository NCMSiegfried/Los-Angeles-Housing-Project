The master bedroom at the very end of the home gives its owner a pleasing space with an extra walk-in closet that we all wish to have when storing all our personal items. The home offers dual-pane windows throughout and an attic that stores the low-voltage media of the home. An upgrade to the system will definitely give its new owner a very efficient use of a smart home system. As you exit the home through either the kitchen or hallway, you will be received with a very lush and green backyard. Its space and privacy will be one you will truly enjoy when having gatherings or even your children play. Privacy and security is just one of the many features this backyard brings. Come and see why you should make this your very next home, it surely will bring many smiles and memories to you.",SINGLE_FAMILY,2814 Grand Ave,2814 Grand Ave,,Huntington

https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/9456998288,WECA,24-359147,SOLD,"We are pleased to present for sale, The Clarendon, a twenty-two-unit apartment building in the Huntington Park submarket of Los Angeles. Located on a quiet residential street comprised of mostly single-family homes, the property is a charming, center-courtyard, walk-up. Built in 1964, The Clarendon features a unit mix of twelve studios, two 1-bedroom/1-bath, three 2-bedroom/1-bath, and a four-bedroom/2-bath house. Recently completed in 2022 was the addition of four additional units comprised of one 2-bedroom/1-bath, one 2-bedroom/2-bath, and two 3-bedroom/2-bath. The additional units are master metered for both gas and electric. Why buy in Huntington Park? Unlike the City of Los Angeles, Huntington Park currently allows for rent increases of 5% + CPI, which is equivalent to 10%. The City of Los Angeles has not allowed rent increases since 2019 and increases on rent-controlled buildings are generally capped at no more than 4%. By allowing higher rent increases Huntington Park gives landlords great flexibility in achieving rents that are closer to market, which is especially beneficial during high inflationary periods. Another benefit is the utility costs are considerably lower in comparison to the City of Los Angeles. New ownership can continue to improve the asset by renovating units as they become vacant, implementing RUBS to recapture utility costs, replacing the leased laundry machines with landlord owned, and continue to give the below market tenants annual rent increases.",MULTI_FAMILY,2966 Clarendon Ave,2966 Clarendon Ave,,Huntington Park,CA,90255,19,26,,14160,1964,129,5300000,2024-02-16,5300000,2024-06-24,,,15869,374,33.983124,-118.215996,Southeast LA,Los Angeles,06037,2,0,,Adam Zunder,azunder@kw.com,"[{'number': '8184321634', 'type': 'Home', 'ext': '', 'primary': True}]",,,,Los Angeles Unified School District,http://ap.rdcpix.com/c5687142c4fa0adbe1a7f7f0682efaf9l-m4084003129od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75,http://ap.rdcpix.com/c5687142c4fa0adbe1a7f7f0682efaf9l-m4084003129od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75

The two-story building was constructed in 1954 and is available for just $132,000 per unit, a very attractive rate when compared to similar sales. A new owner may be able to capitalize on the rent upside, as current rents are approximately 20% below market values. The new investor will benefit from the brand new roof that the previous owner installed in 2018, helping to reduce deferred maintenance expenses. Another factor that favors the new owner is the fact that the property does not require any costly seismic retrofitting (Buyer to verify).Tenants benefit from the building's proximity to retail locations along both Florence Avenue and Pacific Boulevard, including the Pacific Boulevard Shopping District, which is all within walking distance.",MULTI_FAMILY,7120 Miles Ave,7120 Miles Ave,,Huntington Park,CA,90255,,,,4788,1954,,1850000,2020-02-20,1850000,2019-08-27,1983570,2575118,5401,386,33.97409,-118.218622,Southeast LA,Los Angeles,06037,,,,Roderick 'Rick' Raymundo,rick.raymundo@marcusmillichap.com,"[{'number': '2139431800', 'type': None, 'ext': None, 'primary': True}]",,,,Los Angeles Unified School District,http://ap.rdcpix.com/63529957/85281982ca09c2246b90f41617e2149bl-m0od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75,http://ap.rdcpix.com/63529957/85281982ca09c2246b90f41617e2149bl-m0od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75

The property consists of two buildings on a single parcel- a fourplex and a triplex respectively. Four of the units are 1 bed/1 bath, two are 2 bed/1 bath, and one is a 2 bed/2 bath that used to function as two separate 1 bed/1 bath units years ago. Per the LA county assessor, the property is legally 8 units, but has been functioning as a 7 unit property. All of the units are separately metered for gas and electricity. The property also features surface parking and tuck under parking for each tenant. With rents currently 50% under market rate, this presents a great opportunity for a value-add investor to capture substantial upside in rental income by undergoing a rehab program to modernize the units and achieve market rent.",MULTI_FAMILY,2814 Saturn Ave,2814 Saturn Ave,,Huntington Park,CA,90255,,,,4342,1947,,1350000,2023-03-03,1200000,2021-10-01,1248480,1433987,5233,276,33.976738,-118.219347,Southeast LA,Los Angeles,06037,2,,4,Jackson Jorgensen,jack@younglewin.com,"[{'number': '6263992415', 'type': None, 'ext': None, 'primary': True}]",,,,Los Angeles Unified School District,http://ap.rdcpix.com/c037466dd9a69f37dcb642129e595810l-m1487005067od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75,"http://ap.rdcpix.com/c037466dd9a69f37dcb642129e595810l-m1487005067od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/c037466dd9a69f37dcb642129e595810l-m3054428249od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/c037466dd9a69f37dcb642129e595810l-m2662834121od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75, http://ap.rdcpix.com/c037466dd9a69f37dcb642129e595810l-m2246949393od-w480_h360_x2.webp?w=1080&q=75"

Due in part to recent rent growth in the Huntington Park area, the current rents sit approximately 24 percent below those of similar units in the area.Insulated from crowded traffic corridors, the building sits among single family homes and smaller multifamily properties, yet its location still allows tenants convenient access to the Pacific Boulevard Shopping District. The ample on-site covered parking allows space for 20 vehicles, while an on-site laundry room provides an additional income stream for the owner. Several of the roofs are pitched and the building's exterior has been recently painted, providing more durability and reducing maintenance costs.Huntington Park High School, Gage Middle School, and San Antonio Elementary School are all within walking distance of the property, while The Home Depot, Staples, Walgreens, and other national retailers are all within a few blocks.
